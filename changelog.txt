# 0.7.1

+ Support GHC 7.8 again.

# 0.7

Change error type from Text to ValidationFailure.

Revert the 0.6 changes to validate. Also switch from Vector
to list. Validate is now:
  Schema err -> Value -> [ValidationFailure err]

Add fetchReferencedSchemas', which lets the user provide their
own MonadIO function to be used when fetching schemas. This lets
them do things like only fetch schemas from particular domains.

# 0.6

Break the API so the library doesn't induce boolean blindness.

Change validate
  was: Schema -> Value -> Vector ValErr
  now: Schema -> Value -> Either (Vector ValErr) Value

Change Schema
  was: type Schema = Vector Validator
  now: newtype Schema = Schema { _unSchema :: [Validator] }

# 0.5.3

+ Switch from http-conduit to http-client.

# 0.5.2

+ Add convenience function for validating and compiling draft 4 schemas
simultaneously.

# 0.5.1

+ Switch from wreq to http-conduit; drop lens dependency.

# 0.5

+ Start changelog.
+ Rename Utils.hs to Helpers.hs.
+ Move all non-ValidatorGen functions in Validators.hs to Helpers.hs.
+ Various touchups.
